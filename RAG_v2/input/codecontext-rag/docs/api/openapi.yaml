    # CodeContext RAG API
    
    An intelligent code repository analysis system that identifies relevant files for implementing new features 
    using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    
    ## Overview
    
    CodeContext RAG helps developers quickly identify which files they should include when prompting LLMs 
    for feature development. The system analyzes code repositories to understand:
    
    - **Semantic relationships** between code entities
    - **Dependency graphs** and import structures
    - **Historical patterns** from git commits
    - **Structural relationships** from AST analysis
    
    ## Key Features
    
    - üîç **Intelligent File Recommendations**: Get ranked lists of relevant files for any feature request
    - üìä **Dependency Analysis**: Understand how files are interconnected
    - üéØ **Confidence Scoring**: Know how certain the system is about each recommendation
    - üß† **Learning System**: Improves recommendations based on feedback
    - üåê **Multi-Language Support**: Works with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, and more
    
    ## Authentication
    
    All API endpoints (except health check) require authentication via API key:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    
    Get your API key by registering at the developer portal.
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    
    - **Free Tier**: 100 requests per hour
    - **Pro Tier**: 1000 requests per hour
    - **Enterprise**: Custom limits
    
    Rate limit information is included in response headers:
    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)
